                Women's empowerment is the process of empowering women. Empowerment can be defined in many ways, 
                however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means accepting and allowing people (women) 
                who are on the outside of the decision-making process into it. Many people think that the days of woman 
                fighting for rights are over but those people are wrong because 1 out of every 3 woman has been sexually 
                harassed or catcalled in public by random men they don’t know. Every day women are put down and told how 
                to act and that they were asking for it if you wear that making woman feel that it is their fault, it is 
                not. Many celebrities are all for girl power such as Liza Koshy and Lilly Singh (who has her own late night show and 
                has won many awards and also raised money for #girllove and other charities) “This puts a strong emphasis on participation in political structures and formal decision-making and, in the economic sphere, on the ability to obtain an income that enables participation in economic decision-making.”[3] Empowerment is the process that creates power in individuals over their own lives, society, and in their communities. People are empowered when they are able to access the opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Empowerment includes the action of raising the status of women through education, raising awareness, literacy, and training. Women's empowerment 
                is all about equipping and allowing women to make life-determining decisions through the different problems in society.
